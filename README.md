# LEARN Academy: 2022 Delta Technical Interviews

## Process

Two to three students (interviewees) will be assigned to a Zoom breakout room with a Zeal engineer or resident (interviewer). Each student will be interviewed in turn. Each interview should take 30 minutes. The students who are not being interviewed should follow along and attempt each question silently on their own. The interviewer is responsible for the format of the interview.
