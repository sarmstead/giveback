## Candidate Questions (tell me about yourself)
1. Tell me about yourself and what brings you to Stark Intelligence.
1. We're an AI company. So, curious, would you still code if AI can do the job for you?

## Technical Questions (what is your technical knowledge?)

1. Explain some ways to store a collection of data in JavaScript?
  
   _Answer: There are multiple ways to store a collection of data in JavaScript. An object is used to store key-value pairs. An array is used to store lists of data in a particular order. One could also use classes to store, mutate, and delete data. And, at a primitive level, variables store mutable and immutable data._

1. What is a `has-many` relationship? Give an example.  
   
   _Answer: Where one record can be associated to many instances of another record. A user can have blog posts. And a blog post can have only one user._
1. Why might you use an array versus an object in programming?
   
   _Answer: Both arrays and objects are used to store collections of data in programming. An object is useful for representing a single unit of something that has multiple properties. A `car` object, for example, can have multiple properties such as `year`, `make`, and `model`. Arrays are useful for storing lists of items in index-specific order. A `color` array, for example, can store a list of color values such as `red`, `green`, and `blue`._
## Prompt

Stark Intelligence is building a new feature for Tortuga. The AI will listen for a phrase and say it back in reverse. Write a function that takes in a phrase and reverses it, such that 'I love apples' becomes 'apples love I'.
